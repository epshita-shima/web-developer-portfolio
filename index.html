                <p>Hey Shima is here,

                    I am a frontend developer. I can easily build your website. Leading photo editor with lots of
                    experience in background removing and photo retouching and I believe the relevance of a user-centric
                    design depends on how intricate, scrupulous & unambiguous is the user research propelling the
                    design.</p>
